## Description

This project combines **the best** aspects of literature and programming. Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin would shed a stingy man's tear if he lived to this day and saw that his work continues and improves to this day.

## Goals

The goals of the project are quite simple:
1. Read text from file (you can choose your own file, but firstly give a try to Onegin, he has done his best)
2. Sort text by lines, comparing them by
    - their first symbols
    - their last symbols
3. Write 3 sorted variants (including unsorted one) to the output file

> [!NOTE]
> And of course this project is realised with understandable codestyle and optimised functions themselves!
